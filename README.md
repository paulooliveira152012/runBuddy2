# Run Buddy website

# Description

Rub Buddy is a website I worked on as my very first project for the bootcamp where I got to learn and apply some of the fundamental techniques of structuring, styling and deploying a website.

This project was proposed and developed because it is the foundation for web development and therefore will serve as a base for me to apply basic HTML and CSS.

The conclusion of the assignment was accomplished by going over the online material in the student portal at https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses, watching and participating on the online classes, and seeking for assistance by reaching out my tutor during the weekend.

One major challange I faced was with getting aquainted with the git concept and github platform, but after watching a few videos on youtube, going over a few websites seeking for resolutions, walking through the problems with my tutor and the TA's, I ended up being able to move on with the task successuflly.

Looking back at this project, I would say I learned a lot about using the computer terminal, using Github and understanding the concepts behind Git and the proper semantic elements for structuring a website.

I believe I've followed every step on the making of the website carefully, and because of that and the similarities with the mockup, my project wil stand out.
